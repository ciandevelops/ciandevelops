- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cian Butler. I am an Irish ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡ª, Toronto ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦ based Web Developer who worked in Retail Management for 8 years. 
- I have dabbled with programming languages and computers in general from a very young age. The pandemic made me put my head down and work toward what I'm passionate about. I hope to continue learning and achieve my dream of switching careers. I actively use Udemy, TeamTreeHouse, FreeCodeCamp and more, to bring my skills to a new level as I look for a full-time role. I look forward to hearing from you.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Front-End Web Development Focusing mainly on React.js and Tailwind.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Redux/ Back End Tech.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me ... ciandevelops@gmail.com
